# CHANGELOG

This log is intended to keep track of backwards-incompatible changes, including
but not limited to API changes and file location changes.  Minor behavioral
changes may not be included if they are not expected to break existing code.


## 0.9.0 (2017-03-09)

* Removed ods.js source.  The xlsx.js source absorbed the ODS logic and exposes
  the ODS variable, so projects should remove references to ods.js
